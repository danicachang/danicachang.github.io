    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Since finishing my degrees in Computer Science at MIT and Berkeley, I've worked as a front-end engineer at several different start-ups. I'm passionate about building responsive, interactive, and intuitive user interfaces. I'm currently working remotely from various locations in the US and am interested in remote freelance opportunities.</p>

    <p>In my free time I enjoy  <a href="/photographer/places">traveling</a>, taking  <a href="/photographer">photos</a>, skiing, hiking, rock climbing, sailing, and eating <a href="/photographer/food">tasty food</a>.</p>
