            <h1>Cove</h1>
            Cove is a neighborhood workspace that allows members to visit any of its locations all over the city. To allow members to check-in to each location, track their usage, and message with other members, I developed an IOS app, Android app and responsive website using Ionic, Cordova, and Angular. I also built an search engine optimized (SEO) marketing website using Node.js and Handlebars.

            <h1>Custommade</h1>
            <p>Custommade is a two-sided marketplace that helps to connect artisan craftsman with customers to create custom items, from jewelery to furniture. Using Backbone.js, I built intuitive interfaces for customers to request custom merchandise and make payments. I designed A/B tests to test the efficiency of new features.</p>

            <p>As an interview coding project, I built an interactive <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/d_chang/mosaic/mosaic.html">photo collage generator</a>.</p>
